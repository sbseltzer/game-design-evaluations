# Dead by Daylight

Online multiplayer 1v4 kick the can mechanics with character progression.

## Good
1. Multi-layered progression system that encourages returning frequently. How bloodweb in particular interacts with leveling and character building with perks and consumables.
2. Decently addressed a tough logistical problem of a 1v4 multiplayer-only game
3. Multi-faceted state communication (generator/character animations / controls on HUD)

## Bad
1. Some items hard to learn how to use, flashlight in particular
2. Steep skill curve for beginners with poor reaction time / attention spans, skill checks in particular
3. Generally rote activities, lots of hold button or repeatedly tap button

## Steal

The progression by far is where the game really shined.
