# Symphony

Audiosurf, Galaga, and the bullet-hell genre combined. This one was easy to review because there was a lot that was good and a lot that was bad. I played for 75 minutes.

## Good
1. Note to self: anything that personalizes experience based on what's on your device is an instant novelty-boost. Your music is under attack by invadors who corrupt the in-game playback. There's even some mastermind who taunts you to add a little character to the game. Even though I went into it going "meh it's gonna be like audiosurf and I've basically played this before", I was surprised to find myself so delighted by the fact that what little music I had on my PC was in the game. I mean, that on it's own is probably always gonna be pretty cool.
2. Strategy components in ship design. Weapons seemed to be influenced by the music you were playing. Could use some more playtesting to confirm, but this perception is a part that really diversified things for me. The only reason it felt like it was because it had some subwoofer-related items that seemed to do nothing for me, and I was guessing it's because much of my music wasn't bass heavy.
3. Enemy AI and encounters influenced by your music. Also a diversification factor. Some enemies had shields that rotated on beats, other boss-like enemies would slowly enter as a really intense part started playing. It looked pretty cool. I wish more distinct things like this were emphasized because it's easy to get lost in all the swarming and particle effects. Also some longer peices have multiple bosses and difficulty levels throughout it.

## Bad
1. Too much tutorial up front with too many details. To be fair, it's hard to introduce content well in a game that's already so intimate with your music. I remember I got onto my first song and it's even pausing the game/music to explain something to me... that's just not a great feeling. Interrupting a player experience like that is a little jarring. I WANTED TO LISTEN TO MY MUSIC GRRRRR.
2. The strategy components played a pretty minor role in my brief experience. It seemed like the weapons weren't focused enough to make them worth strategizing with. Particularly in that you can even tweak which ones fire when and with what controls.
3. This game took a risk making something where the player's actions weren't really rhythmic, while almost every other of gameplay element did. It wasn't a rhythm game. I think that kinda killed replayability for me and made it feel repetitive. It isn't meditative in the way other rhythm games are.

## Steal
Something that I thought was really cool was that your weapons are influenced by the current environment state. I'm actually kinda wondering if this was a real element, or just an idea this game gave me.
