# Thomas Was Alone

A minimalistic platformer/puzzler about friendship. First session was 65 minutes. This is a hard one to write since it has so many good things to take note of, and so few things I didn't like. Then again, this is a good time to point out that this exercise is not about finding what I like and don't like, but about where the game was strong and where it was weak.

Spoilers await...

## Good
1. The storytelling through narration with a quintessential brittish accent. It had a certain wit about it in how precious the characters are made out to be. They start out being characterized by an archetype: curiousity/optimism, pessimism/denial, condescention/pride, doubt/fear, and protective/self-absorbed. They're all a bit more complex than that, but that's the gist of it. As the story goes on and the characters get more acquainted with each other, there are more interesting interactions. One line that I really liked was「John knew full well he could do this alone, Thomas hoped he'd never have to」which to me began to showcase some character development. Chris later falls in love, and Laura learns trust. But I think seeing them start to grow together as they form a group. The other plus side to narration is it filled in the void created by how simplistic the mechanics and graphics are in the very beginning.
2. Top-notch platformer. Controls were tight. Jump arcs and air control felt really nice. It increased level complexity at a very natural pace. It added something unique early on, in that it's a multi-character puzzler.
3. The graphical polish worked very nicely with platforming. The subtle bounce of the character shape when jumping and landing. The levels had sparse shapes that moved, were less colorful, yet more complex in shape than things in the foreground. There was also a dynamic faux-lighting effect that helped the foreground feel just a little more alive. The physical level geometry that moved also often used a nonlinear interpolation that was satisfying to watch. These are all relatively simple to implement, but added a lot of value to the experience.

## Bad
1. Water physics got a little wonky sometimes, particularly bouyancy of platforms. When jumping on Clair I recall once accidentally killing Thomas and John because of the cumulative forces on Clair. Would have been good to cap that. I might want to confirm this again.
2. There were a few times I wished it was just a tiny bit less challenging, but I felt like playing this game more casually. If I can think of a better bad I'll replace this.
3. Some mechanics only show up once. Early on you have to rush across a collapsing environment. This never shows up again as far as I can tell.

## Steal

You know, this is a rough one, but I think the thing that really made this shine to me was the level of polish. There was clearly a lot of testing that went into tweaking levels, mechanic introduction, and production hacks to the graphics. What it taught me is you can make up for minimalism with lots of simple visual polish and some relateable characters who develop in a sort of story sprinkled across each level. The other thing that story did was motivated me to push through levels where I felt like quitting out of frustration. I got attached because I became invested in the relationships between each character. I wonder if this could also be done in a fast paced action game.
