# Thomas Was Alone

A minimalistic platformer/puzzler about friendship. First session was 65 minutes. Second session put me at roughly 2 hours. This is a hard critique one to write since it has so many good things to take note of, and so few things I didn't like. Then again, this is a good time to point out that this exercise is not about finding what I like and don't like, but about where the game was strong and where it was weak.

Spoilers await...

## Good
1. The storytelling through narration with a quintessential brittish accent. It had a certain wit about it in how precious the characters are made out to be. They start out being characterized by an archetype: curiousity/optimism, pessimism/denial, condescention/pride, doubt/fear, and protective/self-absorbed. They're all a bit more complex than that, but that's the gist of it. As the story goes on and the characters get more acquainted with each other, there are more interesting interactions. One line that I really liked was「John knew full well he could do this alone, Thomas hoped he'd never have to」which to me began to showcase some character development. Chris later falls in love, and Laura learns trust. But I think seeing them start to grow together as they form a group. The other plus side to narration is it filled in the void created by how simplistic the mechanics and graphics are in the very beginning.
2. Top-notch platformer in the most distilled form. Controls were simple and tight. Only left right and jump! Jump arcs and air control felt really nice. Even ground acceleration was fine-tuned. Speaking of, it's worth noting that the "running jump" mechanic that's implicit in ground acceleration has a sort of apprehension factor to it. I always feel myself holding my breath and getting just a tiny bit frustrated, but in a good way.
3. The graphical polish worked very nicely with platforming. The subtle bounce of the character shape when jumping and landing. The levels had sparse shapes that moved, were less colorful, yet more complex in shape than things in the foreground. There was also a dynamic faux-lighting effect that helped the foreground feel just a little more alive. The physical level geometry that moved also often used a nonlinear interpolation that was satisfying to watch. These are all relatively simple to implement, but added a lot of value to the experience.

## Bad
1. Physics got a little wonky sometimes, particularly water bouyancy, clinging to walls, and squeezing the last little bit out of certain jumps. When jumping on Clair I recall once accidentally killing Thomas and John because of the cumulative forces on Clair. I really didn't like that. Later on there are some parts that rely on clinging to a wall of a moving block over a bed of spikes, which at first appeared to be a bug in earlier levels. Actually, I wouldn't even call it a bug, but more like a quirk, since the wall stickyness was not cumbersome like it can be in some other platformers. I also recall there being a jump that was particularly difficult to do that almost seemed impossible - it required timing it in a way that I'm not sure I could replicated, and sorta felt on the fringe of being broken.
2. Let me start by saying that the menus are very aesthetically pleasing. They just suck to use. You cannot use a mouse. That part is fine by me, but the polling rate of the controls feels quite slow on the menu. Not only that, but you can't take shortcuts; the top and bottom items on the menu don't warp like some games do. To make matters worse, to navigate back from submenus like settings, you have to use the top item "Return to main menu" rather than opting for `Backspace` or `Esc` as a shortcut. I'd also expect `Enter` to be an alias for `Space`. I personally like menus that allow keyboard navigation. In this game that is the ONLY option and it does a really bad job of it.
3. Some mechanics only show up once early on and then don't show up again until much later. Early on you have to rush across a collapsing environment. This kind of anxious rush does not show up again until quite a bit later in the game, at which point it becomes much more relevant as a design tool. However not too long after it becomes largely irrelevant again. I'm not sure I would have done things differently since it is trying to tell a story, but it did strike me as strange. I think if stuff like collapsing platforms or scary spikes had been more present, the player might not have focused as much on the story. Perhaps having more anxiety-producing mechanics sprinkled throughout would have made the later introduction of heightened anxiety less impactful, and that could be a good or bad thing. Hard to say.

## Steal

You know, this is a rough one, but I think the thing that really made this shine to me was the level of polish. There was clearly a lot of testing that went into tweaking levels, mechanic introduction, and production hacks to the graphics. What it taught me is you can make up for minimalism with lots of simple visual polish and some relateable characters who develop in a sort of story sprinkled across each level. The other thing that story did was motivated me to push through levels where I felt like quitting out of frustration. I got attached because I became invested in the relationships between each character. I wonder if this could also be done in a fast paced action game.

I think what I learned is that a story can be simple and vague, but still deliver a rich narrative experience by focusing solely on relationships and interactions. The world it takes place in is vague and not terribly interesting, the plot is simple and unsurprising, but the characters can fill that void by being colorful and amusing.
