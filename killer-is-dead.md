# Killer is Dead

I chose a game I never played before for the first to evaluate. I played it for 60 minutes, though much of it was probably cutscenes.

It's a pretty standard 3rd-person hack n' slash game with a strong focus on story.

## Good

1. Good use of common tropes in level design. Specific example was the first time I had to backtrack in the 3rd mission - I got a sapling to give to a quintessential Alice character in a trippy house, and on the way back there were some little cat statues. I was all like "hey i bet those are breakable" so I broke them and stuff came out which I picked up. No idea what they were, but it sure was a satisfying surprise.
2. A good first boss. It made use of all the mechanics introduced up to that point. Slashing combos, adrenaline boost, dodge, counterattack, shooting. There are at least 3 archs to it, and it was probably the first moment I felt addicted. It made sure to give good feedback for when ability usage was intended.
3. Satisfying FX. There were style kills and slashy effects and yeah it was pretty sweet once all the different abilities came together in a fast paced boss fight.

# Bad
1. Too many cutscenes early on. They were long and wordy and I mostly wanted to get back to the action because I was bored out the gate and wanted to just get on with it.
2. Introduction was too slow on mechanic introduction - I was bored up until the boss fight, and spent time introducing things that didn't feel relevent yet, like upgrades and properties of health.
3. The controls were very console oriented and nonintuitive for keyboard - especially in the menus. Particularly the arrow key plus mouse button for the controls and literally nothing else. Extremely frustrating to use and created a bad first impression.

# Steal
Those cat statues, conceptually. I guess in general the light surprise and satisfaction of breaking something open that I wouldn't have noticed without being forced to backtrack. It was also a particularly short first backtrack, simply leaving a room. Break a thing get a thing, basically.
