# What is this?

An exercise taken from [Jeff Vogel's Blog](http://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/2016/09/a-very-long-post-about-how-to-become.html).
> Exercise #2:
>
>Think back to the last 3 (or more) games you played for more than ten minutes. For each one, come up with a list of three SPECIFIC things it did well, and three things it did badly. Then come up with one design element you can see yourself wanting to use in a game of your own.
>
>You should be able to do this for any game. Every game has problems or rough spots, and I've never played for 10+ minutes a game so bad it had nothing to offer (even if it's just a cool little animation on the title screen).

So this is a repository of game evaluations that follow this format.

```
# Game Name
Optional brief description

## Good
Three SPECIFIC things it did well
1. A
2. B
3. C

## Bad
1. A
2. B
3. C

## Steal
One design element
```

# Why?

I saw Jeff Vogel at GDC 2018 and he inspired me to redirect my focus at being a creator of games instead of shooting for being a game programmer. It will get me back in touch with my inner creator, and I think this will lead to becoming a good game programmer in the end. This redirection warrants a blog post of its own, but I'll cut to the chase.
