# What is this?

An exercise taken from [Jeff Vogel's Blog](http://jeff-vogel.blogspot.com/2016/09/a-very-long-post-about-how-to-become.html).
> Exercise #2:
>
>Think back to the last 3 (or more) games you played for more than ten minutes. For each one, come up with a list of three SPECIFIC things it did well, and three things it did badly. Then come up with one design element you can see yourself wanting to use in a game of your own.
>
>You should be able to do this for any game. Every game has problems or rough spots, and I've never played for 10+ minutes a game so bad it had nothing to offer (even if it's just a cool little animation on the title screen).

Thanks Jeff!

This is a repository of game design evaluations. I plan to do these as frequently as possible. I have a massive Steam library of games I've never installed which were likely acquired through bundles. This is a great opportunity to explore games/genres I've never cared for in a new light. I think those may be the most insightful ones to evaluate.

This is the format for each game.
```
# Title
Brief description

## Good
Three SPECIFIC things it did well
1. A
2. B
3. C

## Bad
Three things it did badly
1. A
2. B
3. C

## Steal
One design element
```

## Important Distinction

It's easy for these to turn into a general game review where you talk about what you liked and didn't like about the game. DON'T SIMPLY DO THAT. The point is to, as objectively as you can, disect what worked and what didn't work about the game. What makes it tick? Where did it shine? Where were the rough spots? It's fine to make it about personal taste if it's framed in terms of design strengths/weaknesses, but at face value those types of observations have less value as a design exercise.

# Why?

I saw Jeff Vogel at GDC 2018 and [his presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stxVBJem3Rs) inspired me to redirect my focus at honing my design skills again. Early on in life I spent a lot of time playing, imagining, experimenting, and prototyping before I even knew what that was. Doubling down on programming for years and allowing my creative skills to slip is one of my greatest regrets. I played and made fewer actual games during that time. I got pretty darn good at making tools and engine features, but after all that I had little creative growth to show for it. I consider this to be a sort of catch-up work.
