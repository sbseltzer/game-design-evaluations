# OddPlanet
Basically Limbo on an alien planet. I played it for 22 minutes.

## Good
1. Did manage to differentiate a little bit. At one point it actually dips into slight stealth mechanics, and another you have to go pick something up in one scene then throw it to destroy a big monster.
2. A cool opening cutscene with your character crash landing on an Odd Planet. I liked the orb you crash in. It opens up and your creepy white eyes are the only thing you see of yourself at first. Nice effect.
3. It did a good job with the world itself. The world artwork was probably the most interesting part. The big alien mushrooms, fetuses growing on plants, and weird mysterious life forms lurking about were nice to look at. It had a good color palette too. Dark yet vibrant.

## Bad
1. Didn't differentiate enough for my liking. Much of the same dark aesthetics, almost identical gameplay, though a bit more colorful.
2. The sound was kind of weak. The opening cutscene had pretty poor quality sound effects and the ambient could have been better.
3. Lacked character. Another difference from Limbo was your character actually spoke a bit with a little word bubble, yet somehow gave her less character than the boy in Limbo. She mostly made idle observations and wasn't very thoughtful or interesting. Did not add to the experience or make me relate to the character in any meaningful way. It could have really brought it all together by prompting the player to form their own story. It had mysterious world/character going for it and sorta punted in that regard.

## Steal
I think some of the aesthetics are worth taking. Not so much the effects or world itself, but the subtle life form activity. Little alien bugs and hard-to-see creatures moving around on the fringes of every scene. They were a nice touch filling in otherwise bland empty spaces. It gave the world "life" (hah).
