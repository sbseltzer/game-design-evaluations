# Deus Ex: Mankind Divided

It's incredible how many times one can write a game about the same exact things with a different plot.

I'll just get some basic points out of the way and go into more detail in another revision

# Good
1. One of the best-worst tutorials I've ever played.
2. The gritty 3d art.
3. The setting takes me out of my comfort zone. It lends itself much better to the world it takes place in, and the overall themes of the series than previous games have.

# Bad
1. Holy crap the breadth and depth of game systems is overwhelming! It's very transparent about that upfront.
2. The objective markers and constant spoon-feeding make it easy to miss out on the meticulously crafted environment. I actually had to make a point to stop and smell the roses sometimes just to appreciate the 3d art.
3. Games with skill trees that can't be rearranged make me squirm. There are some seemingly hard choices early on (like permanently disabling an aug tree without knowing how useful they are yet). I don't have a balanced solution to that, but there are so many cool abilities to play with that I want to try them all! I think this may be a gamble for replay value, but still I wish there was a better way...

# Steal

Haven't figured that out yet.
