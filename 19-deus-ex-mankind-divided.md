# Deus Ex: Mankind Divided

It's incredible how many times one can write a game about the same exact things with a different plot.

I've played ~57 hours and completed one playthrough.

# Good
1. Initially I was thinking the tutorial, though I might replace this. It was a bit frustrating and had some rough spots, but it did a good job managing the level of complexity it had to introduce. One moment that stuck out was introducing how to make the most of the Typhoon by cloaking to get in the middle of some enemies first. Also, it does a thing where you can hold tab for it to show a 3-panel description with images for "the thing that just happened" like setting off alarms, even later in the game if it hasn't happened in a while (I think). ALSO it does this thing where in the very first tutorial round where it's introducing mechanics, it lets you enter a sandboxed mode that's constrained to the current room where you can go step by step without consequence as many times as you need to. It even marks/highlights where to stand/traverse. All of this is optional.
2. The gritty 3D art and level detailing was breathtaking. Every indoor space felt LIVED IN. Someone did an incredible job making convincing, life-like, cluttered spaces. Closer inspection reveals incredible modularity, while still making most spaces very unique-feeling.
3. The setting takes me out of my comfort zone. Futuristic setting + social apartheid + foreign country = nothing I've ever experienced while still feeling incredibly real and relevant. The world in this iteration of Deus Ex lends itself much better to some of the primary themes of the series than the previous games have. Specifically conspiracy, corruption, supremacy, and extremism.

# Bad
1. Holy crap the breadth and depth of game systems is overwhelming! It's very transparent about that upfront. This compounds one of the biggest issues I have with the game - the control scheme. The game's systems are elaborate but very well-tuned, yet there are so many of them that the controls become easy to screw up. Early on (and even a bit later in the game) I'd fat-finger an augmentation causing a major gameplay disruption (like activating Typhoon as opposed to Cloak). Sometimes I'd accidentally throw a grenade when I just wanted to open the quick customization menu. The variety of equipment in the game would have made this a good candidate for the Dishonored quick-select/quick-bind menu. DE:MK has it's own rendition of that that's split into 2 parts, but more often than not I found myself wanting to access the quick inventory side, which was not the default. It took a long time before I grew comfortable with it.
2. The objective markers and constant spoon-feeding make it easy to miss out on the meticulously crafted environment. I actually had to make a point to stop and smell the roses sometimes just to appreciate the 3d art.
3. Games with skill trees that can't be rearranged make me squirm. There are some seemingly hard choices early on (like permanently disabling an aug tree without knowing how useful they are yet). I don't have a balanced solution to that, but there are so many cool abilities to play with that I want to try them all! I think this may be a gamble for replay value, but still I wish there was a better way... Also the presentation of experimental augs made me not try them until about 75% through the game. Bad methinks.

# Steal

Haven't figured that out yet. There's a lot going on here. I think I'd like to do another playthrough before deciding.

Also just wanna mention that there is an entire game within this game that is pervasive to the experience: Hacking. I feel like that deserves it's own review. Calling it a minigame would be a disservice to it's level of polish.
