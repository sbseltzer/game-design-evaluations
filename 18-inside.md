# Title

## Good
1. starts right away
2. the heartbeat / distant footsteps sound that was so good I almost thought it was my own heart and I started to get scared - it was very, very subtle. Unlike horror games that abuse it as a way to instill fear, this was very tasteful and moodsetting.
3. no immersion-breaking constructs such as HUD or prompts

## Bad
1. unintuitive control scheme
2. unclear what your character is capable of
3. no clarifying constructs such as HUD or prompts

## Steal

starting right away was a surprise, and it was sorta exhilerating as well because I had no idea what was going on or what the game was even about.
