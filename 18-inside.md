# INSIDE

A dark, visceral, spiritual successor to LIMBO in 2.5D. I liked it enough to keep playing, but I also hate this game at the same time. I'd probably played 1 or 2 hours before writing this, and am finishing it up at the 3 hour mark.

## Good
1. Starts right away. You see the name of the game superimposed on a scene in the background, the title fades out and your character enters the scene. Surprise! The game has already started. Related is it cuts out things that typically distract from an experience, such as HUD, prompts, and menus.
2. Foreshadowing through sound. The heartbeat/distant footsteps sound that was so good I almost thought it was my own heart and I started to get scared - it was very, very subtle. Unlike horror games that abuse it as a way to instill fear, this was very tasteful and moodsetting. The second time I remember this being really good was the shockwave pulse that shakes the whole level for an entire segment of the game before you finally see what it is. There are even touches that warn you like the pressure valve along the way that gives readings on the outside before you even see what's going on out there.
3. It's absolutely terrifyingly visceral. Dogs snapping your neck got me in the goonies. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. Just makes my stomach turn.

## Bad
1. Unintuitive control scheme. It's a hard criticism to make because I love it's simplicity and tightness (in terms of placement on a keyboard), but if you haven't played LIMBO it requires a trip to your settings menu to know what you can do besides moving around.
2. Unclear what your character is capable of. Related to the above. I didn't know how to get over the first wall for the longest time. It was incredibly frustrating, and not knowing I could grab onto things in the background was the source. It totally broke me out of the mood the game had set, which was incredibly done. A whole analysis could be done on how cinematic and moody the experience was. This could have been solved by having some demonstration of characters within the world breaking the 2.5D barrier to suggest you can as well. For something that went out of it's way to get rid of immersion-breaking distractions, it totally broke my immersion in the worst kind of way.
3. Red-herrings. This game is full of them. It's maddening. This is another hard criticism to make, but I think that this game could stand to be a bit more straightforward/easy. Red-herrings feel like a giant slap in the face for me as a player. For instance, the shockwave portion has a lever you pull to stop a machine so it blocks a ladder and protects you from the blasts. At first I thought there was a place to stop it and use that to get across. Turns out using that is the wrong thing to do. I think the only reason it's there is to give the player an opportunity to see what's ahead and FAIL. A LOT. This was probably their intent, and while there's an argument for it, realizing the lever was not a part of the puzzle at all was not very satisfying. It was infuriating. I recall there was another part where the lighting and setup looked like you were supposed to swing on a rope, but it turned out you can keep going up the rope and THAT is the correct way to go. It's funny putting this in the bad section because this is really an example of where this game is strong. It is arguably GOOD design. It is clearly intentional and it does a brilliant job of it. In a way this is the most interesting characteristic of this game. But seriously fuck them for doing this, because it's yet another thing that distracts from the expertly designed atmosphere.

## Steal

Starting right away was a surprise, and it was sorta exhilerating as well because I had no idea what was going on or what the game was even about at this point. It's simple and low-cost and kinda edgy. I liked it a lot. It made such a great first impression and already put me in a sorta mystified state of mind.
