# Risk of Rain
I haven't played any new games in a while so I'm reviewing an old favorite. It's a 2D side-scroller/platformer roguelike with some fairly unique mechanic combos. One of my most-played games according to Steam, currently sitting at 131 hours. Dark Souls III and Rainbow Six Siege are more than twice as high, but this is mostly because I have friends to co-op with who like those games more. Risk of Rain is largely a single player experience, and not a sandbox, which makes the replay-value way more impressive.

## Good
1. HOLY SHIT THE ABILITIES. Seeing how items stack on each other and interact and snowball you into a destructive rampage is incredible once you get good enough. There's much to be said of the emergent design that comes from this sort of gameplay. Specific example: items that modify attack speed and items that proc based on hit count/frequency. There are several attack speed increasing ones and some things like enemy-seeking missiles that have a chance to fire off whenever you hit an enemy which make for a good combo, so increasing attack speed is a great way to increase that chance. There's other stuff like increasing your crit-strike chance based on things like shrine failures, which become relatively less costly if your average gold count is higher. Then there's plenty of stuff that triggers when you have a crit-strike. Some characters simply start out better at some of these things than others. It's amazing how deeply things can chain together.
2. The art. This has one of my favorite minimal pixel-art aesthetics. It's so low-res that it almost doesn't mean anything, and the zoom is so far out by default that you really have to take a moment to appreciate what a great job they did capturing the essence of each character in such few pixels. Granted, this is helped by the fact that there are 2-3 sprites per character. The in-game sprite is the smallest, lowest-res one. The next most detailed is the one in the character selection screen, which has more than enough detail to give them real personality, not to mention they have a very short animation (< 1 second) that plays when you select (or is it hover-over?) them. The most detailed one is stuff that's done in special places, like promotional materials, credits, and the monster log (which I guess doesn't have the player character, but it's the same general tier of detail). Honestly, the first two levels of art are just enough to pack a lot of personality into the game. The eye-candy tier could've been scrapped and it would've been just as good, though I'm sure that was a seller for some people.
3. The "secret sauce" mechanic: Difficulty = Time. To become proficient in this game, the single most important thing to do is to pace yourself. It's balanced so that if you rush through levels, you'll be underpowered in future ones due to a lack of items/XP. If you spend too long in a level, you'll see steep diminishing returns on how much XP you gain and perhaps more importantly how useful the extra items (if any) will be for you. This is a delicate balance that has to be learned the hard way, and somehow they managed to make it compelling enough to die 30+ times before you become good enough to make it past level 1.

## Bad
1. It's REALLY hard, but only for so long. On one hand, I probably died 30-50 times before making it past level 1 on a semi-consistent basis, but for some reason I stuck it out. This is definitely a hard-core game. Probably close to Dark Souls in some ways, though it has a lower cap in terms of experiences that will keep it hard. DS uses knowledge of levels to do this, whereas RoR uses mechanics, RNG, and item memorization. Once you get a sense of the RoR formula, the time it takes to become good at it is limited by the kinds of enemies it can throw at you which is relatively small. DS keeps it harder for a much longer time by having more variation in level design and enemy placement which interacts with how challenging an enemy will be in that specific situation. The AI in DS takes much longer to get a sense for. If RoR took some tips from that it would have drastically increased replayability. This connects to how random levels can be, which I cover in more depth later.
2. Multiplayer balance. I think LAN MP is one of the things that makes this game great, but the balance is sub-par. This is because of the snowball effect mentioned in the Good qualities. If one player carries another, the other player(s) can end up permanently underpowered for the rest of the game. This got improved later, I think, but this is at least a historic flaw from when I originally played this. I believe this could have been improved by balancing difficulty of enemies per player more appropriately by modifying AI priorities, though a more low-budget approach is to scale XP by their relative level, which is what I think their approach may have been later on. I think this is a lazy solution that devalues the hard-core experience, but maybe that's not the point when it comes to co-op.
3. Not as random as it could be. I think this was a budget constraint. It's pseudo-procgen, and did it by swapping out chunks of pre-designed levels with others in consistent ways. This is the easiest to implement in terms of gameplay consistency, but it led to less variation than I expected from a Roguelike.

## Steal

There are a lot of things I'd like to take from this that aren't even mentioned above. The platforming is some of the best in terms of how movement feels, even though the controls are unintuitive by default and require some adjustment. Just like other masterpiece hardcore games, the design creates many opportunities to impose artificial constraints on yourself to increase the difficulty such as self-enforced item restrictions, artifact choices, intentional playstyle restrictions, etc.

In terms of what I'd steal that feels somewhat unique to this game, it'd have to be between emergent character builds that it achieves with the combination of character abilities and items, and the artifact design. Bastion was the first game I played that featured an equivalent called Shrines, but I HATED them. They made the game harder, but not more interesting. Risk of Rain perfected this by making them disrupt balance in fun and interesting ways. They also served as a way to make achievement/unlock hunting more attainable, though I would've liked an authorative way to try and achieve them in vanilla mode as well as an extra challenge post-unlock.
