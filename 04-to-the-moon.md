# To the Moon
A top-down point-and-click adventure game. JRPG-esque in look/feel but focused almost solely on story. Delicate, melancholy atmostphere. I played for an hour and a half.

## Good
1. Really starts off strong as if it were a comedy, which is weird considering growing old and dying is the theme. It injects comic relief throughout which never failed to make me laugh, both in dialog and action. One hilarious/lushious display of developer effort was implementing JRPG combat mechanics, namely the interactive interface for it, only for a single encounter, which literally amounted to nothing but a joke for the sake of some dialog that didn't even need to happen. That experience lasted all of 30 seconds. I couldn't be happier.
2. The theme: Death, aging, mental and physical illness, financial hardship, love. It's as dark as it is soft and gentle. The full piano original sound track echoed these feelings perfectly. Made me feel things.
3. There was this pretty nifty bloom/vignette effect it used early on when fading between cutscenes. Everything would fade to black except for a soft glow of the windows in the house. I don't know why that gave me feels, but it did stick out and make for a very cozy early experience.

## Bad
1. Navigation. Actually exploring the world physically was the most clumsy part of the experience and probably the only immersion breaker. I always felt like I was getting sorta stuck on the world.
2. Sorta related to navigation, the control scheme was weird in general. It seemed to favor mouse as a point and click, but keyboard was the best tool to get around most of the time. This was never explicitly stated. At the start of every location it would remind you that you use the mouse to move, but it just didn't feel right. The disparity in convenience made it feel more like a confusion between point-and-click and JRPG controls. I think if focus was to be the mouse, click+hold should have been a follow-cursor mode like Sword&Sworcery and other modern point-and-click adventure games do.
3. The in-game menu, I guess. It wasn't overtly bad but it felt like it lacked something. It could have used a little TLC to feel more cozy like the rest of the experience. It was artistically in line with the rest of the experience, but quite plain. It almost felt like there might have been more stuff to put in it. Even a little vignette post-processing would have gone a long way in bringing it together.

## Steal
This isn't something it did particularly well, but the fact that it's fine to tell a rich story and keep things interesting by adding a few shallow minigame activities throughout. It's enough to tie together an experience without being too intrusive or obvious. Plenty of games do this, but this game in particular was very much a vessel for a story. I'm not sure how I want to go about using that in a game of my own, but it did show me that if your theme and story is deep enough you can get away with blatantly shallow gameplay. To a great extent you may remove gameplay for long stretches without it feeling weird. If I ever have a story to tell that's so compelling, I'll probably go light on gameplay just as this game did.
