Okay ready?

## Good
1. It confronts a difficult topic head on: Rape. This is an important and culturally relevant topic to tackle as a society. This is a noble thing for a game to do.
2. It tells a story from the victim's perspective, and gives you a number of choices that alters the story, but not the outcome. This was important to do for the subject matter and it became obvious over time that you were being railroaded by you aggressor. This is very real. It has significant impact on the player.
3. Later on, the distinguishing mechanic was that you are forced into only one choice. You could click the button to resist but it would do nothing. Not even playing a press animation on it really drove the point home. You're frozen. You want to save yourself but cannot, and so you are forced to pick the alternative. This is also all too real is an extremely painful experience for the player. The sense of violation is so real.

## Bad
1. It confronts a difficult topic head on. This can be harmful to the developer, players, and the visibility of the game, but I guess that's not really the point. It is critically acclaimed and won multiple awards, so this was a success, but it easily could have drawn fire.
2. Some minor spelling mistakes (easy to miss though). Could benefit from a proof-read.
3. I think the background music could have been more subtle. It gave it a disturbing air, which should be a good thing for this game, but I think it had too obvious of an influence on my choices.

## Steal

I... I just don't know if there's anything I *want* to take, but I feel as a creator it may be my responsibility to do so. I want to make a game like this, but I don't at the same time. All of the distinguishing mechanics are intended to take away from the player. There is no winning. The outcome is the same, and perhaps best of all, you cannot retry. At the end you have a start over button, only to disappear. In it's place is the disturbing truth "There is no starting over. This happened." I've never seen a game so concisely *show* me what it's like to be a victim of rape, from the inside, experiencing it. I'm not sure a game ever made anything feel so real for me.

I've always wanted a game that could concisely show someone what a crippling depression is like. This reveals some ways of doing that. There's a similarity in that it's all about taking choices and outcomes away from the player through narrative mechanics. I'd like to show what it's like to have a distorted perception of the world around you as far as it's narrative is concerned. It plays into the deepest darkest fears of how the world operates around you. So to be specific, give the player choices that allow them to express their desires, but it always results in the same outcome. In this case, it's through the aggressor's actions. In the case of my game, it would be through self-compromising actions. I'd like to find other mechanics that can express this, but I have not found them yet.
