# Master Reboot
A surreal first person puzzle game where you work for a company that maintains memories of the deceased for the purpose of preserving their "soul" so to speak. Dark forboding techy aesthetic. I played for 38 minutes in my first session.

## Good
1. Right off the bat it's pretty weird and managed to be engaging because of it's strange environment and low-poly aesthetic contrasted with relatively complex lighting. The cube you interact with had this super trippy effect where it was small and shot off into the distance maintaining its perceived size, which meant as you approached it again it was large enough to fit you inside it. Really cool effect and was pretty wowing as a first impression.
2. Good job indicating what could be interacted with. Plenty of games do this well and plenty do it poorly. A hovering hand sprite indicated this, and did a good job matching the art style.
3. There were these scenes where gigantic things would chase you. It managed to invoke those feelings of dread, panic, and momentary horror of something that overwhelms you. It is so remeniscent of childhood nightmares. One was a giant teddy bear chasing you as simple obstacles with fearful messages on them slowed you down along the way. Another was giant dark doll-like figures instantly consumed you upon encounter, sending you back to the start of the level. This was in the "childhood memories" level, and there are many other memories throughout life I have not tried yet. Still, this one really nailed it for me, and that is an impressive experience.

## Bad
1. It made a lot of assumptions about familiarity with controls. It was basically Half-Life controls, though there was some redundancy to alleviate this. Still, 'E' for interact is markedly Source Engine games. Not everyone would be familiar with that, and there was no introduction or indication of what the controls were from the start. This could have been solved by simply displaying the binding on the interact icon that showed up when aiming at things.
2. When you interacted with some items it would give you something to read. Unfortunately the 'Esc' key went to the main menu instead of closing it. You needed to press the interact key again, which was frusterating for me.
3. The giant dolls consume you send you just far enough backward to be annoying traversing that segment of the level. Sending the player backward about half-way through the level to the start of the maze would have been tolerable since that's the only part that mattered in terms of remembering which paths were dangerous.

## Steal
If there's one aspect I could take from this, it's triggering the experience of evokative dreams. I think this would be worth playing later levels to see what else this game has to offer in that category of experiences.
