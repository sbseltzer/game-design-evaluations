# Finding Paradise

Sequel to [To The Moon](04-to-the-moon.md) which I previously reviewed. This is my first sequel review, I think. Mechanically this is nearly identical, so it'll be an interesting challenge. I played 45 minutes in my first session.

## Good
1. More of the same, particularly in terms of writing. Right off the bat I was able to choose Niel and kick a kid's toy into a pond as a sort of sick punishment for that kid doing the same to another kid. Poetic justice. It was predictable, but man was it satisfying to watch. It was the same as the last game, but better in a way. I think that's an illusion created by keeping the momentum of a sequel, but that almost deserves it's own praise. In any case, one thing that stands out is the sense of mystery this introduced regarding Niel's activity, particularly with the extra Sigmund Corp installments of the first game.
2. Movement had improved. Keyboard felt a bit better which may have been an improvement in level design, and it felt like less emphasis was put on mouse. There wasn't as much control-scheme confusion between point-and-click and JRPG. Mouse was still available which was nice at times, especially when my wrist has enough of arrow keys and needed a change of pace.
3. Introduced new things early on. I think it wasn't till later in the first game you could switch between character who had two completely different activities. There was even a funny moment where they crossed paths during their separation, in a sense. Niel notified Eva of a *Code 32* or something which meant toilet paper was not put on the dispenser and she rushed over to put it on because Niel is a jackass who was taking advantage of her OCD and feined laziness. So good. She promptly leaves after putting the toilet paper on the dispenser. It also started with a new puzzle type to activate mementos. It ALSO had cosmetic/humorous character customization. I decided for them to look exactly the same but only change their socks for giggles. It was pretty great. What a unique twist!

## Bad
1. More of the same, in terms of movement frustration. I think there was room for improvement as it could be more generous in assuming where you wanted to go. It's a solveable problem since there's rarely (if ever) 2 doors/transitions per surface.
2. Changing decisions post-decision would've been nice. First instance was a sealed book. I couldn't decide to open it after I chose to leave it alone. I can see why they did this, but for indecisive explorationists it's hard to pass up changing my mind. I wish I could have conveniently changed my mind in that one case. Would've been nice to be able to customize characters at any time for fun as well.
