# The Dark Mod

Open source fan-game implementation of Thief, an immersive sim.

# Good

1. It kicks it off with a snarkily narrated slideshow-like mission intro that reminded me of Garrett. Felt good man.
2. It managed to be a minimal immersive sim. NPCs react to you in more than one kind of way (sound of you/objects, sight of you/bodies, ???) and sort of reacted to each other.
3. Working brightness settings that updated realtime.

# Bad

1. The AI kinda sucked and was way too sensitive/unforgiving. God save you if someone spotted you once - they'd never let it go unless you outran them which was hard with the size of the maps.
2. Bad feedback. It wasn't totally clear what was loot, and it also wasn't obvious what could be picked up. Most things that seemed interactive were not. Doors should make a sound when you try to use them.
3. No tutorial for controls. If I hadn't played Thief before it would have been very frustrating. Even having played it before, knowing where everything was and what to press was not obvious at first. Cues on screen as needed would have been useful.

# Steal
I want a good character that introduces missions with a snarky voice and a low-budget slideshow-like thingy to draw the player into the world. Takes talent to do convincingly, both in writing and voice acting. The visual composing is also pretty important, but definitely less the focus.
