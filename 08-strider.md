# Strider
2.5D ninja platforming action. I played for 22 minutes in my first session.

## Good
1. The jump animation. Most platformers have a way to drift while in the air. This has that, except when you're jumping it basically plays the animation in reverse. It looks super cool since it's actually more like a flip, but cartwheel-style. One really neat effect that creates is when jumping over enemy heads, if you decide to change your direction it almost looks like you're pivoting off the top of their heads. This may not look the same if the jump height was higher.
2. Wall climbing is rad. Once again, it came down mostly to the animations and controls looking really good together.
3. Okay let's just take a second to appreciate that you're a ninja and you get to slash things up right out the gate.

## Bad
1. Some of the movement when running (there is no walking for ninjas). It didn't feel right. I think it may have been most noticable when running downhill was the same speed uphill or flat. This just means the controls are tight, and that's good in a platformers, but this just felt awkward. It also felt very... I dunno, like the legs/feet aligned *too* well with the surface. Like, it was so IK-looking that it just felt weird. I'll have to play more to get a sense for why this stood out.
2. Got to the action quickly and mission reset was fast. I think that's nice, but also got frustrating fast. Those seem connected to me, but I'll have to think more on why that is.
3. I did not like the aesthetic. Cyber-ninja sounds good on paper, but the bright color palette and sorta corny street-fighter-esque character design didn't jive with me at all.

## Steal

Getting to the action quickly. It did not need a lot of explanation. I think games that get straight to the core gameplay fast are good, but I think the thing you have to be careful of is pacing - you don't want to give the player an overdose on it in the first 10 minutes. I think that may have been related to the problem I had with mission resets and how fast retries went.
