# NEO Scavenger

A hex-board rougelike RPG about survival and scavenging in post-apocolyptic lower-Michigan. 

This is the first game I'm reviewing that I've played previously. Decided to give it a shot.

## Good
1. The writing. It opens up strong with RPG writing. I think it was how it gave details that are relevant to the player's senses and how they interact with the world. Example: The feeling of dust-caked ground sticking to your skin leaving a clean spot on the floor (with a number on it). It even slightly changes the writing and available options based on your abilities/flaws.
2. Scavenging. You start with essentially nothing and need to find clothes, food, water, and stuff like bags to carry more things. You can end up spend a lot of time organizing inventory and figuring out what to take/leave.
3. Mechanically deep. For every ability there is a flaw you lose and vice versa. Adding flaws allows you to select more abilities. Most of them have very obvious impacts on gameplay. Particularly in what helps you scavenge, what risks you're liable to, and how likely you are to be rewarded. Having strength helps you find more things but attracts enemy attention in nearby tiles. There's a lot to be said about the balancing of the mechanics themselves. Every single choice has drawbacks.

## Bad
1. Not as many plot-points as I would have liked. It has a number of very well-written ones that take advantage of all the mechanics this game has to offer, but they are few and far between. More points of interest and flavourful experiences would have gone a long way in getting me to replay it. Many of them were too spread out in progression, as far as survival is concerned, and I think that perhaps hurt some of the replayability.
2. It's one of the hardest games I've ever played. With such an interesting plot, it's a shame that I've never finished the story due to the roguelike nature of it. I remember when I first played this game I savescummed to make it far and then somehow lost my save. Can't remember how, though it wasn't the game's fault. I was pretty upset.
3. Dominant choices in ability selection. Most of the skills feel useless for most of the game. Particularly hacking and electrician. There just are not enough applications for them early game. Even mechanic is less useful for quite some time. This could have been partly-solved by more plot-points that have options to make them rewarding abilities because you're sacrificing more useful ones for basic survival. There are some other actions like offering to talk with potential foes. I've never once seen it pay off, and there are so many ways that it could.

## Steal

Every choice has drawbacks. Seems like a way to work toward having mechanical depth, especially when it's balancing more than one benefit and drawback. Probably a staple in most designer playbooks.
