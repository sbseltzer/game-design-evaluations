# Rainbow Six Siege
Asymmetrical tactical shooting excellence. I've logged 330 hours so far.

I've been generally averse to reviewing games I like to play a lot. They're hard to review because I've played them so much and have many good things to say. There's also something elusive about what the goods and bads are at their core. Anyway, I think for those reasons they are the most important games to evaluate. I think I will have to half-finish a lot of them and come back to them later, since they're so hard to nail down.

## Good
1. Analytics. The developers use a comprehensive statistics implementation to balance the games. It's very in depth. Pick rates on characters, weapons, win-deltas, the works. It's crazy. And it works really well. This isn't really a design element; it's more of a means for them.
2. More a tactics/strategy game than a shooting game. That is, it's an information game. The teams that seem to win are the ones who know more about the current situation, particularly of the opposing team. This of course depends on the ability to leverage the information by the formation of a strategy in real time. In that sense it's an RTS-FPS, but without a defined commander. Supreme information requires supreme teamwork so they really nailed the need for cooperation. How well they facilitate that on the other hand...
3. One thing that instantly struck me when starting out is that this game is how Cole, my friend who introduced me to this game, keeps in touch with his old friends. The game had a way of keeping them together and roping in a couple of other second-degree people such as myself. I don't know if there was anything in particular about the game itself. Maybe it's how team-oriented it is. I think there are plenty of other games he's done this with, but I feel like it's still a notable quality to fulfill as a multiplayer game.

## Bad
1. The communication interfaces need a lot of TLC. Even if more than one person is voice chatting, it can only have one of their names show up on the screen to indicate who is talking. Also the text chat has no history (which is maybe good) and doesn't work like most text editors (ctrl-left_arrow doen't jump back by one word). Also mics cut out between phases, such as round end to character selection and vice-versa.
2. There needs to be a mic-only mode in ranked. Really badly. If you don't have a mic, you are a detriment to your team and it's ridiculously annoying to deal with. Not to mention it's horribly balanced in that it's so hard to get out of the lowest leagues. I think the mic requirement could help with that.
3. Partying with randos could use a lot of improvement. When you choose to stay as team, it should automatically create a temporary party so you have more time to bond while in queue.

## Steal

I think if I were to distill the part of Siege I'd take away, it's the "cool factor" you get on the attacker side when you're infiltrating like a well-oiled machine as a team, except for me I'm more concerned about giving an individual more control over that feeling.

This was a real tough one. There's a game I've wanted to make for over 3 years that Siege is strikingly similar to. I code-named it "squads" and the earliest GDD I can find was last edited ‎‎2015‎年‎4‎月‎30‎日 which means I could have begun writing it while I was still in college. It was rescued from a corrupt drive so a lot of creation date info got lost in copying.

It's like Siege but an RTS where you control multiple ops. Stuff like lots of personality-packed ops is fluff. I'm more interested in the concept of controlling a small squad as your "Player". In my original concept of it, I was thinking having multiple players, "Squad Commanders", per team, each with their own squad. Success would hinge on each squad accomplishing certain objectives individually, then using the benefits of those to help their fellow commanders. I envisioned it as more of "securing a large facility" rather than Siege where it feels like you're only trying to secure and/or hold some rooms.

As a later perspective I've been thinking my take-away would hold up better as a 1v1 or a PvE game first and foremost. Siege does not hold up as well in those cases, which is something I didn't note, but I never saw those as an aim for it. If I were to stick to my original multi-commander concept, I'd like to make the teamwork/communication aspect even more satisfying when executed successfully, but perhaps not as much of a determining factor as it is in Siege.
