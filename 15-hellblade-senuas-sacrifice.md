# Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice

A mythical descent into madness. I played 2 hours over 2 sessions. I only made it past one of the bosses, which was all about illusions and so my evaluation will be colored by that experience. Core gameplay seemed to be centered around "fear" (such as balancing on narrow surfaces at risk of death), puzzles, and combat. Not a hard game, but certainly brutal.

## Good

1. Does a very good job emulating mental illness. The discouraging voices, ruminations, depression, trauma, hallucinations; it's all expressed in some way. You get to experience it firsthand. It's incredible. Much of it comes through excellent sound design. I recall a presentation of how they did the recording - they used an actual human ear mold to surround the mic. Incredible attention to detail for voice acting and recording. It simply would not be the same without a surround sound headset. Luckily mine supported virtual surround sound.
2. The rot. It's a... roguelike? Basically this mechanic is: every time you die, the rot spreads. It starts from your hand and moves up your arm toward your head. If it reaches your head, it's game over and all progress is lost. Simply brutal. Not only that, but every time you beat a boss the rot will also spread! Every victory brings you closer to defeat. 
3. Man this game is pretty. The shader effects are top-notch. Never seen anything quite like them. Both subtle and world-bending hallucinations, simply magical lighting effects, just... wow. One that was really neat (though simple) were eyes appearing on various surfaces. It was very subtle in how it was introduced.

## Bad

1. Too repetitive. This is particularly the case with combat. It only had a few tricks and it milked them mercilessly. It got to the point of almost being unfun, and that's pretty early on in the game too. This may have been the point, given that it feels very much about experiencing a crippling mental illness, but I think that part was probably the greatest flaw.
2. As pretty as the game was, there was one thing that stood out as a little lackluster - water. The first moments of the game are paddling through water. Even at max settings, I would have expected it to look at least as good as the character (she was very realistic looking). The rest of the world also looked really nice. I dunno, it's really a nitpick, honestly.
3. It introduced the rot mechanic with text on the screen. I'm guessing it was a texture because it wasn't localized to the subtitle language. The real problem with this is it sorta broke away from the very vocally-focused experience. I wonder if maybe they could have introduced it in a narrative fashion.

## Steal

This is a great realization of a game that captures mental illness, trauma, and helplessness. The ruminations in particular were a pretty essential part of the experience for me. In real life they can be more nuanced than what is heard in the game, but it did a good job nonetheless. They discourage, they confuse, they mislead. As someone who has experienced what it's like, both vicariously and otherwise, I can see a lot of potential for turning that into a mechanic. I wonder if it could be done textually. It's worth exploring.
