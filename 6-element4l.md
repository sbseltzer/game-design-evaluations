# Element4l
A sorta Zen physics game about elemental forces and love. Or at least that seems to be what it's going for. Between 2 sessions I logged 56 minutes.

## Good
1. You start as a bubble and can only apply small forces upward. It's not much; you need to rely on the wind. The simplicity of trying your best to match the ebbs and flows of the world was challenging yet strangely relaxing. It did a very good job in conveying a go-with-the-flow concept, perhaps due to the simplicity and tight constraints, without being immensely frustrating.
2. Introduction of mechanics was smooth. The levels were short and exactly one core mechanic was introduced per level. This made for a very good introduction.
3. There's something super satisfying about the way the ice slid, especially when you timed it just right. Going smoothly from air to surface without any hiccups feels great. At the same time, there's a certain level of suspense created. That moment when I tense up in anticipation hoping my jump connects.

## Bad
1. It started out pretty Zen and relaxing but ramped up out of that pretty quickly as it added mechanics. I wish it could have preserved that feeling a bit better. Although mechanics were introduced smoothly, they multiplied complexity when the level presented more than one new element. It turned it more into a game of skill.
2. There was some friction in transitions between physical shapes - particularly rock and ice. This made certain parts of the puzzles a bit frustrating. If they fudged physics a bit in certain parts of the level to make it feel smoother it could have lowered the difficulty bar enough to make the gameplay more carthardic.
3. I'm not sure how I felt about "Mr. Smooth", the "show how" help mechanic that was available at all times. That's probably because I'm a more harder-core gamer. It seemed like the game was very confused between whether it was hard-core or relaxing. It would have been much better to break it into two modes.

## Steal
I really liked the Zen feel when it was present. I think the first level where you only had one navigation key and working with the wind was the most compelling for a look and feel. This would fundamentally change the level design, but the feeling of following the wind is something I've wanted to implement for a while. The tight constraints puts the burden on the level design, but I don't think that's a bad thing.
