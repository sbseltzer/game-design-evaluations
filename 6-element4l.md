# Element4l
A sorta Zen physics game about elemental forces and love. Or at least that seems to be what it's going for.

## Good
1. You start as a bubble and can only apply small forces upward. It's not much - you have to rely on the wind. The simplicity of trying your best to match the ebbs and flows of the world was challenging yet strangely relaxing. It did a very good job in conveying a go-with-the-flow concept, perhaps due to the simplicity and tight constraints, without being immensely frustrating.
2. Introduction of mechanics was smooth. The levels were short and exactly one core mechanic was introduced per level. This made for a very good introduction.

## Bad
1. It started out pretty Zen and relaxing but ramped up out of that pretty quickly as it added mechanics. I wish it could have preserved that feeling a bit better. Although mechanics were introduced smoothly, they multiplied complexity when the level presented more than one new element.
2. There was some friction in transitions between physical shapes - particularly rock and ice. This made certain parts of the puzzles a bit frustrating. If they fudged physics a bit in certain parts of the level to make it feel smoother it could have lowered the difficulty bar enough to make the gameplay more carthardic.
