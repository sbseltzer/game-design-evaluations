# XCOM: Enemy Unknown

Turn based squad strategy game about an alien invasion. I played two sessions of it and logged 2 hours total.

# Good

1. Excellent integration of cinematics throughout game. Not too long or too short, and tied into mechanic introduction in a very natural way. There are numerous examples, nearly every other in-base action was like that. One cool one was when you elected to send an interceptor jet out to shoot down a UFO and it plays a nice cinematic cutscene of it launching and striking. Early on theres a lot of introduction of things scientists want to research like building light armor.
2. Good pacing on mechanic introduction and early limitations. For example, at one point it taught me about using the scroll wheel to switch elevation so actions on higher levels like rooftops could be performed. Later on in a separate mission it introduced zoom right when it felt sorta convenient to have, which was a pleasant/unexpected FYI. It also didn't feel too intrusive or bothersome - no popup/confirmation - it just showed up in the corner of the screen and disappeared once performed.
3. Did a good job with communicating possible actions and what the effects of each were. Pretty much everything was highlighted and color-coded to indicate subtleties in choices. For instance, movement had places you could travel in a nice grid-like pattern, and it had an outer ring colored yellow to indicate sprinting to it which would use all of your moves for that turn. Cover surfaces were marked with shields and cover that was visible to known enemies was highlighted red.

# Bad

1. Some things weren't super well-communicated early on. Like how many moves each unit had per turn. It was represented by some blocky rectancular arrow thingies next to each other that hovered in front of the unit. Early on it wasn't obvious to me. Maybe it was mentioned, but it must have been just vague enough for me. It could have simply emphasized it a little more with like a blinky outline on the icons while taking the turn and darkening the inner color.
2. I wish the localization options had been in the in-game settings. This is probably not important to most people, but for me it was a bit inconvient to have to look for the option in the Steam menu. Would have been a nice touch, as I've often seen it in other games.
3. I know I selected tutorial mode, but it railroaded me a bit longer than I would have liked. It prevented me from building facilities that looked interesting and I kind of wanted to experiment/explore at that point. Maybe it was to continue the well-tuned introduction, but man that's a long tutorial. But it did do a good job getting me used to what kinds of strategies were available, like that finding cover was a priority, even before any combat took place. Felt overkill at first, but it wasn't as bad as it could have been.

# Steal

That super tight mechanic introduction. It felt very natural, kept momentum, and wasn't very intrusive. They were mostly non-obvious things and didn't feel artificial. They always were brought up right when they would be convenient and it kept things fresh pretty consistently.
